# Loan Qualifier Application with CSV File Results

This is a command-line interface (CLI) application in which end users can input their own personal data in order to be considered for a loan. The application will scan the `data_rate_sheet.csv` CSV file in order to determine whether a user would be qualified for a lona and if so which loans. Then the application will finish with creating a CSV file of all the loans a user is qualified for so they may easily view and share the results.
